example variables: t1, t2, t3;
example lables: label1, label3;

-----Arithmetic-------

t1 =i t2 +i t3			// t1, t2, t3 are int variables, add t2, t3 and assign to t1;

t1 =i t2 -i t3			// t1, t2, t3 are int variables, subtract t3 from t2 and assign to t1;

t1 =i t2 /i t3			// t1, t2, t3 are int variables, divide t2, t3 and assign the integer quotient to t1;

t1 =i t2 *i t3			// t1, t2, t3 are int variables, multiply t2, t3 and assign to t1;

t1 =i t2 %i t3			// t1, t2, t3 are int variables, divide t2, t3 and assign the integer remainder to t1;

t1 =f t2 +f t3			// t1, t2, t3 are float variables, add t2, t3, and assign to t1;

t1 =f t2 -f t3			// t1, t2, t3 are float variables, subtract  t3 from t2 and assign to t1;

t1 =f t2 /f t3			// t1, t2, t3 are float variables, divide t2, t3, and assign the result to t1 

t1 =f t2 +f t3			// t1, t2, t3 are float variables, multiply t2, t3 and assign to t1;


-----label---------
label1:			//copy this as it is, this is a label


----declaration---------
int t1					//declare a int variable t1 in the .data section and assign it the value 0

float t1				//declare a float variable t1 in the .data section and assign it the value 0

bool t1					//declare a word t1 and assign it the value 0

char t1					//declare a word t1 and assign it the value 0


-----elevation--------
t1 = elevateToFloat ( t2 ) 		// t2 is float, convert it to int i.e, remove fractional part and assign it to t1, t1 is a integer variable


-----conditional-------

-------Assignment---------
t1 =i #1							//t1 is a integer variable, assign 1 to t1; constants start with #

t1 =f #19.8							//t1 is a float variable, assign 19.8 to t1; sample code: "li.s $9, 19.8"

t1 =b #true							//t1 is a bool variable, assign 1 to t1;

t1 =c #'b'							//t1 is a char variable, assign 'b' to t1; define b: 'b' in .data section and do 'lb $9, b';


t1 =i t2							//t1 and t2 are ints, move t2 to t1;

t1 =f t2							//t1 and t2 are floats, move t2 to t1;

t1 =b t2							//t1 and t2 are bools, move t2 to t1;

t1 =c t2							//t1 and t2 are chars, move t2 to t1;


-------IO statements---------

print int t1						//t1 is an integer, print it;( syscall );

print float t1						//t1 is an float, print it;

print char t1						//t1 is an char, print it;

print bool t1						//t1 is a bool, print t1;
